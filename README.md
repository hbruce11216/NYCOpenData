Using the Housing Maintenance Code Complaints dataset, you can get a window into what complaints are being reported to the city because the landlords are not taking action. People who have the money to fix their own problems aren’t filing complaints with 311. Tenants with great and responsible landlords aren’t filing complaints with 311. The people filing housing complaints with 311 are likely low-income or are tenants with delinquent landlords who need their house fixed and have nowhere else to turn to.

When these reports are filed to 311, they should be analyzed to determine their application (are they electrical issues? Plumbing issues? etc) and then a file/case should immediately be created for the problem that is pushed out to the network of users (contractors, plumbers, electricians, handy-men) who can then bid on the project. 

This process supersedes the landlord. Maybe it would make sense to have the landlords create accounts where their profiles specify a range they are willing to spend for certain things. Some landlords have more disposable income than others and some are more inclined to put money towards giving their tenants a good living experience than others. That’s fine. Having them set bounds for what they are able to spend makes it such that the contractors can bid on the project when it is posted.
